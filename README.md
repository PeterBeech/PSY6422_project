# Overwatch League 2019 Visualization & Analysis
PSY_6422 visualization project

The primary aim of this project is to visualize the distribution of hero popularity, and the severity of dominance of a single strategy during the **OWL** 2019 tournament. This will allow us to observe the effect on overall hero pick variety, and thus evaluate the game's developer's decision to implement a role lock (limitations on the number of each character type that can be played).

The project was coded using the R language

/data contains data required for the project
/figs contains images required for the project, and visualization ouputs

Data descriptions - /data/rawdata/datasource.txt
